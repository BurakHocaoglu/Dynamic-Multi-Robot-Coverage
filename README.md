# Dynamic-Multi-Robot-Coverage
Aims to achieve robust, reliable and real-time coverage with multi-robot systems in 2/3D with on-/off-line capabilities.

* Reliability, as to the communication between the agents of the swarm.
* Robustness, as to completeness of the algorithm for the given task with fundamental concepts like collision avoidance

## To Do
* Implement Lloyd's Algorithm to result in Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT); then, move on to Power Diagrams ([Aurenhammer](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Spring20/Aurenhammer87.pdf), 1987) for heterogeneous coverage capabilities within swarm.
* Many things to come ...
