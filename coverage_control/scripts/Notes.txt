Notes
-----

* Define the problem of interest
	- Partition
	- Task Allocation
	- Movement to the execution-start point, if necessary
	- Task Execution

* Define the factors to consider
	- Multiple holonomic robot setup as a swarm (preferably quadrotors)
		-- Distributed optimization and execution
		-- Kinematic and dynamic constraints over motion

	- Minimal energy consumption
		-- Minimal number of turning maneuvers 
			--- At the expense of more overlaps

		-- Minimal jerk, snap

	- Minimizing total completion time

	- Convex / Non-convex polygonal environments
	- Convex / Non-convex polygonal obstacles
	- Known / Unknown environments
	- Uniform / Non-uniform environments

	- Limited sensing and/or communication

	- Keeping uncovered region of the whole environment a connected shape
	- Connectivity constraints, if necessary and/or applicable
	- Collision avoidance - separation rule of Reynoldsâ€™ flocking
	- Cohesion behaviour based on shared information

	- Robot failure cases (Fault Tolerance)
		-- Communication failures
		-- Mechanical failures

	- Motion planning support in case of undesired local minima traps

* Consider the forms of multi-robot coverage problem
	- Complete coverage (requires steady motion)
		-- Sweep-like motion
		-- Frontier based

	- Locational optimization
	- Pursuit-evasion or capture behaviour

* Consider the different solution to the different forms of the problem
	- FILL HERE

* Complexity analysis of previous approaches

* Complexity analysis of the proposed approach and/or algorithms
